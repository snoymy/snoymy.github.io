      <description>IoT Home Automation Project This project is my internship project. My job is about learning how Zigbee Protocol work, design and develops system to work with IoT devices without internet. Also create an API to provide ability for user to config how IoT devices should work together in if-then condition.
I developed a program that run as service on NanoPi Neo board as a gateway to recieve data from sensors (Zigbee devices) and check value from sensors if the value is match with condition that user had config then trigger the action to other devices.</description>
